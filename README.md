# Drosophila-Lunge-Classifier
Kayser lab ML project classifying drosophila lunges 

Main file is BenAutomate.py which contains all the functions for automation. LungeV1.jab is the lunge classifier but is too big to upload to GitHub so I'll keep it for now. Additional files important to the project are get_lunges.m, auto_track.m, auto_calibrate.m, classify_behavior.m, and calib_bg_estimate.m.
